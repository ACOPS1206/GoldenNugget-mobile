# Rebuild the vendored idevice static library for iOS, with the patched jktcp.

#   Vendor/IDevice.xcframework/ios-arm64/libidevice_ffi.a   the artifact
#
# Why this script exists rather than a `cargo build` in your terminal:
#
#   * the toolchain lives in this repository, under .rust/, via RUSTUP_HOME and
#     CARGO_HOME. Nothing is written to ~/.cargo or ~/.rustup, and nothing is
#     installed with Homebrew, so it also runs where those are unavailable.
#   * aws-lc-sys (the default crypto backend, and the one the shipped binary was
#     built with) needs cmake. The recipe takes it from the managed Python venv
#     rather than Homebrew, for the same reason.
#   * the jktcp version is pinned by the [patch.crates-io] stanza, so a `cargo
#     update` cannot silently walk the build back to the unpatched release.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build-idevice-ios.sh            # build only; print where the .a is
#   scripts/build-idevice-ios.sh --install  # also swap it into Vendor (backs up)

# `lto` and `codegen-units` are overridden back to cargo defaults on purpose.
# The shipped archive was cut that way -- 1924 members, one codegen unit per
# crate -- while the workspace's own [profile.release] asks for lto + 1 CGU.
# Two reasons to match the shipped shape:
#
#   * LTO merges every string constant into one, and scripts/patch-idevice-
#     target-identifier.sh is an in-place 16-byte substitution on a literal.
#     Under LTO its one remaining "SourceIdentifier" is shared by all four
#     call sites, so patching it also rewrites the Info/List/Extract dicts.
#     At 16 CGUs the copy is per codegen unit and only send_request is hit.
#   * With lto + codegen-units=1 the app crashed non-deterministically in use;
#     at 16 CGUs it does not. Not root-caused -- matched, not explained.
