"""Check that the AirliftFFI archive the app links is the one this source builds.

    scripts/check-airlift-install.py

Three archives are in play and only the middle one is linked:

    Vendor/AirliftFFI/rust-core/target/aarch64-apple-ios/release/libairlift_ffi.a
        what `cargo build --target aarch64-apple-ios` just produced
    Vendor/AirliftFFI.xcframework/ios-arm64/libairlift_ffi.a.pristine
        that build, kept as the de-duplication's input
    Vendor/AirliftFFI.xcframework/ios-arm64/libairlift_ffi.a
        the de-duplicated copy, and the only one the app links

The failure this exists to catch is the quiet one: the Rust is edited, the crate
is rebuilt, and the rebuild never reaches `Vendor/`, so the app links the
previous build and the fix is in the source but not on the device. Comparing the
`al_*` entry points does **not** catch it — the export set is the same 13 names
whichever build produced the archive, which is exactly what a first version of
this check reported: a stale archive and a current one both "matched". So the
evidence is content, not symbols:

  1  the pristine is the current build, byte for byte
  2  the linked copy's members are a subset of the pristine's, and there are
     strictly fewer of them — the de-duplication ran, and it ran on this build
  3  the linked copy's members are byte-identical to the pristine's, except for
     a bounded handful the de-duplication rewrote in place
  4  the `al_*` entry points are unchanged by all of that

Check 3 is a bound rather than a proof for a specific reason: the de-duplication
demotes 1680 duplicate definitions to local, which rewrites the members that
mixed shared and private symbols. It reports the count instead of hiding it, so a
number that grows is a question worth asking about.

What this cannot catch: a linked copy restored from a backup of an older build
whose changed members happen to be the same ones the de-duplication rewrote.
Re-running `scripts/build-airlift-ffi-ios.sh --install` is the fix for that.
