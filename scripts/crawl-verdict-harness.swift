// Regression harness for the tunnel-crawl verdict in Nugget/Core/StallGuard.swift.
//
// The rule is "the tunnel is stuck", and it has to accept every shape of stuck
// while leaving healthy and recovering streams alone.  Two of those shapes are
// easy to miss, and both were missed in production:
//
//   A  STATIC hole   the device retransmits the same out-of-window segment, so
//                    `seq` never moves, `expected` never moves, the gap is
//                    byte-for-byte constant and only the counter climbs.
//                    A growth requirement rejects exactly this shape.
//   D  trickle       the hole closes, but below the rate floor (3.9 KB/s).  Not
//                    delivery worth keeping.
//
// Run:  xcrun swiftc -O -o /tmp/crawl-verdict-harness scripts/crawl-verdict-harness.swift \
//         && /tmp/crawl-verdict-harness
//
// Numbers are taken from the 2026-09-19 poc.log runs; `pollSeconds` is 5 s in the
// real guard, and the streams below step at the same rate.
//
// Expected output (current rule):
//   A new: VERDICT   (old: no verdict — the bug this harness exists for)
//   B new: VERDICT
//   C new: no verdict
//   D new: VERDICT   (below the floor is a crawl by definition)
//   E new: no verdict

// at 52 % for 200 s, and that the NEW term (gap must not be closing) accepts both
// shapes while still leaving a healthy stream alone.
