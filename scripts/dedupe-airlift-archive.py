"""De-duplicate AirliftFFI's static archive against the IDevice archive we already link.

## The problem

`AirliftFFI.xcframework` is a prebuilt Rust `staticlib` from AirCard-iOS.  A Rust
staticlib is self-contained: it carries a compiled copy of everything it depends
on, including `core`/`alloc` and its own vendored `idevice-ffi`.  This app links
`IDevice.xcframework` (`libidevice_ffi.a`), another Rust staticlib built with the
same toolchain, so both archives carry the same `alloc` with the same crate
disambiguator — the symbols come out *identically mangled* and the link fails:

    ld64.lld: error: duplicate symbol: <alloc::string::String>::from_utf8_lossy
      defined in string.rs:628 (library/alloc/src/string.rs:628)
      libidevice_ffi.a(alloc-9b236de5ba37b474.alloc...)
      libairlift_ffi.a(airlift_ffi-1b820065ad47369a.alloc-9b236de5ba37b474...)

1680 symbols are defined by both archives.  They cannot be separated at member
granularity: the offending CGU also defines 17 private symbols that the rest of
the archive references, so deleting the member breaks it, and keeping it keeps
the duplicates.

`-allow_multiple_definition` would paper over this, but xtool exposes no linker
flag and the manifest that owns the final link is regenerated into
`xtool/.xtool-tmp/` on every run.

## What this does instead

Two steps, both operating on the archive's own metadata:

  1. Delete every member whose defined symbols are *all* also defined by
     `libidevice_ffi.a`.  Nothing can reference such a member for a symbol it
     uniquely provides, so the linker loses nothing.
  2. In the members that define a mix, demote the shared symbols to local
     (clear `N_EXT` in the symbol table) while leaving the code, the names and
     every private symbol alone.  References from elsewhere in the archive then
     bind to `libidevice_ffi.a`'s copy — the same std the rest of the app
     already uses.

Only the symbol table changes; no instruction and no symbol name is touched, and
the FFI's public entry points are never demoted (they are not in the shared set,
and that is asserted).

## Why not `llvm-nm`

The vendored `llvm-nm` is LLVM 21, the archives are LLVM 22.1.8 objects, and it
reports `Unknown attribute kind (105)` and *skips* those members — silently
leaving a third of the symbols invisible, which makes every collision analysis
built on it wrong.  The Mach-O symbol table is read here directly instead, so
the result does not depend on the toolchain's LLVM version.

## Usage

    python3 scripts/dedupe-airlift-archive.py            # rewrite in place
    python3 scripts/dedupe-airlift-archive.py --check    # report only

`libairlift_ffi.a.pristine` next to the archive is the untouched input, so
re-running is idempotent, and a failed assertion restores from it.
