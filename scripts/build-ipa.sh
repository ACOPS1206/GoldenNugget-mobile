# Build an unsigned device IPA from the Xcode project.

# Output: build/GoldenNuggetMobile.ipa (unsigned — sideload via AltStore/SideStore/LiveContainer)
#
# --clean wipes build/xderived first.  Reach for it after touching anything
# under Vendor/: an incremental build can refresh a .swiftmodule WITHOUT
# relinking the app, so the build reports success while the IPA still carries
# the previous logic.  The staleness check below catches that either way, which
# is why it looks only at the linked binary and not at the modules.

# Strip symbol tables out of the *copy* we are about to package, not out of
# DerivedData — the unstripped product stays available for debugging.  This
# build is unsigned (CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO above, the sideloader signs
# afterwards), so nothing is invalidated, and Release already asks Xcode for it
# via COPY_PHASE_STRIP; the explicit `strip` here makes the IPA lean regardless
# of which configuration produced it.  Worth ~8.5 MB raw: 47% of the app binary
# and 33% of EMProxy is symbol table, nearly all Rust names from statically
# linked vendored libraries.
