"""Emit the daemon groups GoldenNugget's Daemons page exposes, as Swift.

Source of truth is the reference itself: `src/tweaks/daemons_tweak.py` (the
`Daemon` enum, the interface whitelist, the recommended set) and
`src/gui/ios/daemons.py` (which groups get a switch, and their titles).

Why this is separate from `gen-tweaks-from-goldennugget.py`: that one walks
`registry.py`, and daemons are deliberately *not* in the registry. Upstream
registers them at `load_daemons()` time as a single `AdvancedPlistTweak` over
`/var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/disabled.plist`, and the per-group switches are
built in the GUI rather than declared as tweak specs. Modelling one spec per
group is what makes them survive the port's Apply / autosave / preset paths,
which all work off the catalog.

Two facts the reference is careful about and this file has to carry:

  * `INTERFACE_KEYS` is the whitelist. Every daemon outside it must never reach
    the plist, a preset or the apply pass -- upstream says disabling those
    "broke whole apps on iOS 26.5".
  * 40 daemons are interface-visible but only 34 have a switch. The other six
    (AppleAds, CrashReports, Diagnostics, Feedback, SettingsStats, Shazam) are
    reachable only through the one-tap Recommended set, which is why they are
    emitted with `showsSwitch: false`.
