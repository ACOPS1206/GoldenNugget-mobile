# Type-check the GoldenNuggetMobile sources WITHOUT running xcodebuild.
#
# Why this exists: `xcodebuild` needs to evaluate SwiftPM manifests, which means
# it shells out to `sandbox-exec` and writes ~/.swiftpm.  In a sandboxed
# environment that fails with "sandbox_apply: Operation not permitted", leaving
# no compiler gate at all.  `swiftc -typecheck` needs none of that — it only
# reads the SDK and the already-built .swiftmodule files, so it runs anywhere.
#
# The gate is only as fresh as those .swiftmodule files.  If you changed
# anything under Vendor/, rebuild once with Xcode first, or the check will
# report phantom "has no member" errors for symbols you just added.
#
# Usage: scripts/typecheck.sh [path/to/Products-iphoneos]
