/// On-device wireless pairing (iOS 27 RemotePairing), as an observable service
/// rather than as page state.
///
/// This app used to acquire its pairing record one way only: the user had to
/// bring a `.mobiledevicepairing` file from a computer (or the installer).  With
/// iOS 27 the device can pair **with itself**: an app publishes the
/// `_remotepairing-pairable-host._tcp` service, the device's RemotePairing daemon
/// discovers it, and the two complete a host/device pairing on the phone.
///
/// ## Why this drives AirliftFFI, not Minimuxer's `wirelessPair`
///
/// The vendored Minimuxer carries a whole `WirelessPairAPI` for this, but its
/// two halves never met: the Rust side (`pairable_host_accept`) self-advertises
/// through `mdns_sd`, which iOS blocks for a normal app because it needs a
/// multicast entitlement; and the Swift side publishes a `NetService` whose TXT
/// is hand-written as `txtvers/id/model/name` (`IdeviceGateway.swift:2208`),
/// missing the `authTag`, `flags`, `ver` and `minVer` keys the daemon matches
/// on.  A service the daemon cannot recognise never becomes a "pair" row, which
/// is exactly what the device showed.
///
/// `AirliftFFI`'s `al_pairing_run_host` is AirCard-iOS's proven fix for the same
/// problem: Rust binds the listener and hands back the **full** TXT records
/// (`PairableHostInfo::mdns_txt_records`), and the app publishes *that* with
/// `NetService` — which goes through mDNSResponder and needs no entitlement.
/// See `AirliftPairing` for the binding.
///
/// The object owns the two callbacks — the service becoming ready and the PIN —
/// and the completion, and publishes them for the home page's Connection
/// section.  It deliberately does **not** import or adopt the generated record
/// itself: the file lands at `AppPaths.pairingFile` through the library, and the
/// page hands it to `loadPairingFile`, so the ordinary validate → write →
/// read-back → claim contract stays the one path a record enters the app by.
