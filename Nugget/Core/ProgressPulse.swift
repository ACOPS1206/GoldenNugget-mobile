// `AppLog` rather than the engine so they can be used from anywhere.

/// Wall-clock cost of one stage, reported in the app log.

/// Added because "it takes forever" is unactionable: the run has several
/// multi-second-or-multi-minute stages (tunnel probe, minimuxer readiness, each
/// backup attempt, the restore itself) and without per-stage numbers there is no
/// way to tell a slow transfer from a stage that is merely sleeping.
