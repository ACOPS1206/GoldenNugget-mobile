/// "Skip Setup": the two files upstream's `add_skip_setup` adds to **every**

/// page is on.
///
/// Reference chain, all in `~/GoldenNugget`:
///
///   * `src/devicemanagement/device_manager.py:324-353` (`add_skip_setup`) —
///     appends the two files, cloud configuration first, and gates the whole
///     block on `pref_manager.skip_setup`;
///   * `src/restore/skip_setup27.py` — `SKIP_ALL_PANES` (the pane list; emitted
///     into `SkipSetupCatalog.swift` by `scripts/gen-skipsetup-from-goldennugget.py`)
///     and `build_cloud_config`, whose seven fixed keys are reproduced here;
///   * `src/restore/restore.py` — on iOS 26 the block rides the legacy
///     domain-delivery path, which is why the two files always carry real
///     domains even though nothing else in the apply does.
///
/// The file/row order is the reference's and is load-bearing only in the sense
/// that the directories must precede the files they contain — which is what
/// `TweakInjector` builds from the two payloads below, in this order:
///
///     SysSharedContainerDomain-systemgroup.com.apple.configurationprofiles
///         "" · Library · Library/ConfigurationProfiles · …/CloudConfigurationDetails.plist
///     ManagedPreferencesDomain
///         "" · mobile · mobile/com.apple.purplebuddy.plist
///
/// **Deliberate divergences from the reference**, both reported as warnings on
/// every run so they cannot be mistaken for parity:
///
///   1. **No merge with the device's existing configuration.**  Upstream calls
///      `MobileConfigService.get_cloud_configuration()` and passes the result to
///      `build_cloud_config(existing, …)`; this port has no lockdown service for
///      that, so the file is written from these seven keys alone.  Any other key
///      the device was carrying in `CloudConfigurationDetails.plist` is therefore
///      not preserved.
///   2. **No `SupervisorHostCertificates`.**  Upstream generates an x509 from a
///      keybag (`pymobiledevice3.ca.create_keybag_file`) when the run is
///      supervised with an organization name; this port has no keybag generator,
///      so it writes `IsSupervised`/`OrganizationName`/`OrganizationMagic`
///      without the certificate and says so.  `SupervisionView` already states
///      that supervised delivery is not implemented here; this keeps that honest
///      rather than writing half of it silently.
