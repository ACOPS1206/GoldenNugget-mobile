/// Watches a long device call. **It observes and reports; it does not time out.**
///
/// WHY THE TIMEOUTS WERE REMOVED (2026-09-20)
///
/// This used to abandon the call on four separate deadlines: a silent handshake
/// (45 s), a stalled stream (idle → out-of-band probe → `maxIdleSeconds`), and a
/// tunnel crawl (an out-of-order flood with a gap that would not close). Every
/// one of them ended by walking away from a call the FFI cannot interrupt, and
/// the retry ladder then rebuilt the session underneath it.
///
/// The measured cost, from the 2026-09-19/20 runs: abandoning a mid-flight
/// mobilebackup2 exchange tore the session down while the device was still in
/// the middle of it. The device-side daemon then stayed wedged across app
/// restarts — every following attempt connected to `mobilebackup2` and never
/// received a `DLMessageVersionExchange` at all — so a run that had merely
/// stalled became a run that could not proceed until the device was rebooted.
/// Rebuilding the tunnel never once recovered a transfer; it only added the
/// wedge.
///
/// The trade is therefore explicit, and the operator's:
///
///   - a stalled call keeps waiting, with a live heartbeat below;
///   - `CancelFlag` — the stop button — is the only thing that ends it early.
///
/// All of the watchdog's *measurements* are kept, because they are how this
/// stall was ever diagnosed: the handshake-silence check, the two wire clocks,
/// the delivery-rate window and the out-of-band probe still run and still
/// print. What is gone is the part that acted on them.
///
/// `mobilebackup2_backup` has no deadline of its own, so a genuinely dead run
/// now blocks until it is cancelled. That is the deliberate choice: a visible
/// hang with a stop button, instead of an automatic teardown that needed a
/// device reboot to recover from.
///
/// A second consequence, and a good one: `ChannelRecovery.recover()` calls
/// `invalidateConnection()`, which is only safe once the failing call has
/// actually returned. With the timeout paths gone, the retry ladder can only be
/// entered by an error the FFI itself threw — a cancel is `failFast` and never
/// reaches `recover()` — so the teardown can no longer race a call that is
/// still in flight. That race is exactly what `InFlightCall` exists to prevent,
/// and it is no longer reachable from here.

    ///   - `idle()` — the host delegate callbacks (a file arrived, a chunk
    ///     landed), i.e. payload actually moving;
    ///   - `wire()` — the wire counters in the Rust log (DeviceLink messages,
    ///     plus jktcp's out-of-order segments and the byte position it can
    ///     actually deliver).
