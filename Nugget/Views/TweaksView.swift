/// The layout is the reference's `IOSTweaksPage`: a 56 pt nav bar over a scroll
/// body with 16 pt margins, an uppercase section header per registry section,
/// and **one card per tweak** — the switch rows as `IOSCard` + `IOSSwitch`, the
/// value rows as `IOSSettingsRow` with the current value echoed beside the
/// title.  The two extra lines this app renders (the tweak id and the registry's
/// description) ride inside the same card instead of moving to a tooltip, so the
/// page still shows everything it showed before.
